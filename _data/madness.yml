              Stage magazine - “There aren’t many tribute bands better than Badness. Their lead Suggs is perfect and the whole band musically tight, loud and all great musicians. they do Ska, Bad Manners et al too, as well as the nutty boys, so have an extensive range of material the can call on. Whatever they choose to perform is fine by me - they’re fantastic and a benchmark to other tributes.”
