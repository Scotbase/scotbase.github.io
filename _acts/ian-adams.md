description: freddie mercury tribute ian  adams has always had a love for QUEEN & Freddie Mercury's music & a huge fan at heart. It couldn't help go unnoticed that when performing some QUEEN songs with bands, they always stood out in the shows & were well received the most by audiences.So in light of this, Ian in 2014 conceived the idea & decided to embark on his journey to become a Tribute to Freddie Mercury. This decision was not taken lightly & he knew this was not an easy task in which to take on!To attempt to emulate the persona, stage presence & charisma of a true legend as Freddie was, it was a indeed a huge task. However a wonderful challenge & journey began. No expense was spared on the best specially made replica outfits, to provide the most authentic look of Freddie possible!For 12 months Ian studyied  Freddie's mannerism, stage presence, facial expressions & his whole complete stage persona. Although Ian had the vocal range to sing pretty much most of QUEENS classic hits in the original keys. He now had to alter his vocals to add the Freddie phrasing & tone and it certainly paid off as Ian has taken his solo Freddie Mercury tribute show nationally & internationally,  and has been greatly received by audiences.ian has performed as freddie at celebration functions, restaurants, hotel's, theatres, festivals, bars & holiday parks.  if you love Freddie mercury this show is for you. <hr>
