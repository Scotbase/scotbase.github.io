description: take that tribute band Take That 2 have consistently kept the top spot as the UK's Number One tribute to Take That. We just cant get enough of Gary, Mark, Howard, Jason and now of course Robbie. With no expense spared and no corners cut this really is the most professional and realistic Take That tribute band available today. With live five part harmonies and live lead vocals all of the artists have studied every detail of their character in depth, so when you see them you really feel like you are watching the genuine thing! The show comprises of Take That as a four piece singing all your favourites from Beautiful World and Circus, including a solo spot from Mr Williams himself, and then the fab five come back together again performing all the classics, along with hits from the new record Progress! This is a night you won't forget.... Take That 2 quite simply Rule the Tribute World! <hr>
