description: Elvis needs no introduction as the undisputed King of Rock n’ Roll but it takes a very big man to step into those Blue Suede Shoes. Standing at 6’5, Paul thorpe delivers a credible show of the highest standard.No wigs, no cheap gimmicks,  just pure Elvis with DELUXE costumes and a deep respect for the MAN AND his music. Paul entertains from curtain to the ENCoRE.none of the obscure songs and all of HIS GREATEST Hits, delivered with style and watched in awe. Elvis IS dead YOU love him, don’t miss this fantastic elvis tribute show. <hr>
