description: blondie tribute band dirty harry, Formed in Edinburgh in early 2011. Dirty Harry was borne out of singing doctor, Sarah Kennedy’s desire to create a act which could play homage to everyone’s favourite rock goddess, Debbie Harry and to the band who practically invented Power Pop, Blondie. <hr>
            Having perfected the style and moves of the icon behind such classic power pop songs as Atomic, Rapture and One Way Or Another, Dirty Harry has not only the original sound, feel, attitude, and full back catalogue of the band but a look- a- like of debbie  to deliver the goods for yout club, party or event. The essence of Dirty Harry is to put on a show Blondie would give the nod to and in true punk style we can embrace any sort of venue, function or odd request so feel free to test us out.<hr>
