description: ariana tribute show, Simply Ariana, is fronted by the  famous Scottish Rockette Gemma Lamont. Trained in the Estill Voice System her technical training shines through  as she effortlessly hits Ariana’s impressive high notes. She not only mimics Ariana’s vocal capabilities, but also her physicality, choreography and American accent.All shows also come with two professional backing dancers and the full production feels like a real concert but at a fraction of the price. You will not find a tribute more accurate for staging, costumes, vocals and choreography! Simply Ariana is Simply Amazing!  great for all Venues and Events, gemma lamont is The Best choice for girl band Themed Occasions. <hr>
