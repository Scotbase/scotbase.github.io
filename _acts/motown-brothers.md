description: The Motown Brothers are one of a few funky but sophisticated with an African twist groups currently in the UK. The group consists of 3 members with an average of 25 years performing experience amongst them. Each with their own individuality and creativity they have developed the Motown show which has proved to be favourite with all ages with superb close harmonies and individual solo numbers.Unlike most other Motown groups as well as the experience they still have youth on their side which enables their choreography to be a cut above the rest. Over the years of working with different age groups, cultures and societies they have learnt and gained the experience of judging and entertaining each audience differently and acknowledging the individual requirements for each venue. With this group you have the whole package, the looks, the moves and most importantly the voices. Don’t come expecting to sit down….the music just won’t let you! <hr>
