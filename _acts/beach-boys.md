description: The UK BEACH BOYS are the NO 1 Beach Boys tribute act, having performed throughout the UK and Europe since their formation in 2002. They re-create the superb sounds of Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys, performing totally LIVE without tracks or artificial backing, giving a true representation of LIVE  music. They are also the ONLY Beach Boys tribute to have appeared with THE BEACH BOYS. <hr>
