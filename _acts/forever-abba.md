description: forever ABBA TRIBUTE SHOW reproduce Abba live in concert with particular attention to detail. Packed full of excitement and vivacity, forever abba are a huge draw and tickets sell out quickly. Since being established in 1998, this show has been perfected and recognized as one of the greatest recreations to Abba. With their immaculate attention to detail, both on and off stage there’s no wonder this Abba show has been shown numerous times on TV and broadcast on the radio. With the bespoke costumes and authentic lightning design, the aim for this show is to take you back to the 1970’s and it succeeds. audiences are  dancing from the first great number to the last. this is an amazing tribute show that you will never forget. <hr>
