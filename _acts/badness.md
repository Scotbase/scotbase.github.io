Their lead Suggs is perfect and the whole band musically tight, loud and all great musicians. they do Ska, Bad Manners et al too, as well as the nutty boys, so have an extensive range of material the can call on. Whatever they choose to perform is fine by me - they’re fantastic and a benchmark to other tributes.” The Ull said - “I have to say they played all the songs really well, they are a tight band and great showmen too, they know how to please an audience.” Badness have cemented their reputation as amongst the best tributes in Europe with The Stage recently producing an article of the Top 10 Tribute Bands highlighting Badness.
