description: outstandining female vocalist Janey kirk started singing professionally at the age of six. At that young age she was whisked away every weekend to perform at various functions across Fife and beyond.By the time she left school she had a following of fans who came to see her five nights a week at two local venues. It was while singing at one of these venues she was approached by the manager of a young band named Hi-Lite. With them she served her apprenticeship performing across the whole of Britain in theatres, clubs and corporate events.After three and a half years with Hi-Lite and aged 24, Janey appeared on New Faces where she came in second place. This was when her career officially took flight. She was asked to sing with Joe Loss at Blackpool’s Winter Gardens, sing with Vince Hill, and work with The Nolans. She toured Britain with Sydney Devine and appeared on “Your Cheating Heart” with Guy Mitchell.
