description: the grande experience tribute show, presented by kearra bethany, is a stunning Tribute to American Singer Ariana Grande. With a stunning lookalike/soundalike factor and featuring costume changes and dance routines, kearra covers all the popular Ariana Grande hits with great accuracy.All shows also come with two professional backing dancers and the full production feels like a real concert but at a fraction of the price. You will not find a tribute more accurate for staging, costumes, vocals and choreography! Simply Ariana is Simply Amazing!  great for all Venues and Events, gemma lamont is The Best choice for girl band Themed Occasions. <hr>
