description: jUST paul & JOHN  are the most notably  fronted The Beatles tribute Show in the uk.  they have honed to perfection the live aspect  of their show, playing note for note exactly as john & paul played on th ir records. Glen with the trademark  Hofner violin base guitar, recreating Paul’s unique melodic base playing style. for even more authenticity, the “Fab Gear” sound is completed with original 1960s Vox equipment. The sound is right and the look right, with the boys in their Pierre Cardin suits and cuban heels. <hr>
