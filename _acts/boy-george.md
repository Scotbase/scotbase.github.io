description: Daniel Winters performs an outstanding Boy George Tribute Act, one of the 1980s most iconic characters.
boy George led Culture Club into the charts in 1982 with the classic Do You Really Want To Hurt Me? A song that is as recognisable today as it was back then.This was the start of the Boy George dominance of the eighties with outstanding hit songs and outlandish dress sense. Daniel has perfected this impersonation down to the last detail, The vocal likeness, the style, the costumes are uncannily close, making this probably the best Boy George Tribute Act in the UK today. Donâ€™t just take our word for it, have a look at the video above. <hr>
