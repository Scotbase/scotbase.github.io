description: elton john tribute  Rus Anderson was Elton John's official body double  for his 'Farewell Yellow Brick Road' world tour videos & photos!  The St Petersburg Times was 100% right when they said of the rocket man show  “A show as extravagant as Elton's career”. In the show, Rus recreates the magic & live persona of a young Elton like no other. Storming around the stage with a fun-loving sense of flamboyance; part diva, part soccer player, killer vocalist, fierce piano player, all rock & roller. book today to avoid disappointment. <hr>
